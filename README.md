# DynamicWebPage
I made this website 
the main page(index.html) features a clock with a background that changes based on the time of day
you can also input informaton on it that is then stored in a library using java script
for the rest of the pages I used a free online template that contain a menu that pops up off to the side as well as recommendations of anime,manga,kpop, and dramas

I used javascript, html, and css for this project
